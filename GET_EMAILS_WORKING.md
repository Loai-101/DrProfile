# Get Emails Working - Step by Step Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem
The appointment form is working but emails are not being received because we need to set up a real email service.

## âœ… Solution: Web3Forms (Free & Easy)

### Step 1: Create Web3Forms Account (2 minutes)
1. **Go to**: [web3forms.com](https://web3forms.com)
2. **Click**: "Get Started" or "Sign Up"
3. **Enter your email**: q9g8moh@gmail.com
4. **Create password** and verify email

### Step 2: Get Your Access Key (1 minute)
1. **Login** to your Web3Forms dashboard
2. **Copy your Access Key** (looks like: `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`)
3. **Keep this key safe** - you'll need it in the next step

### Step 3: Update the Code (30 seconds)
1. **Open**: `src/components/DoctorProfile.js`
2. **Find line 98**: `access_key: 'YOUR_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY'`

4. **Save the file**
